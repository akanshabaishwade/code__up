    As a professional, you should always be looking to learn new skills.
     After all, the more you know, the better you’ll stand out from the competition – in a job search,
      when competing for a promotion or raise, etc.
    LinkedIn Learning is an American website offering video courses taught by industry experts in software,
     creative, and business skills. 
    It is a subsidiary of LinkedIn. All the courses on LinkedIn fall into 3 categories: Business, Creative, and Technology.
